        + This can also be triggered by single-clicking the system tray icon (Windows/Linux only).

        - The user cannot initiate a new request if one is already in progress.
        - Updates will still occur automatically, however the timer is reset after a user-initiated update.
    + A player page open request can now be initiated by double-clicking the system tray icon (Windows/Linux only). This will perform exactly the same action as selecting the corresponding application icon menu item.

        + The saved details can be deleted by logging out and unchecking the "remember details" checkbox.
        + Details are saved when a login attempt is made with "remember details" checked.
    - Fixed some minor errors.

Version 2.5.0

    + The version number is displayed in the bottom-left corner of the login window.

Version 2.4.7

The window is now always created in the centre of the primary screen. Note: compatibility has not been tested yet on other operating systems.
    - changes.log is now included with the installation package (and can be found on the root of the installation directory).

Version 2.4.5
    + Added icons to show the number of active characters from 1 to 15
    - Changed the behaviour of the iconManager: a set of icons is loaded into memory as a result of being set as the current icons, and icons are unloaded when they are no longer directly in use
    + Prevented any tray icon from being created during a login sequence involving an open login window
    - Changed update request method to POST for greater security

    - Changed login.htm to resize its self dynamically based on its content
    + Added a status field to the login window
    - Made some miscellaneous code changes
    + Changed the server response "ERROR Hacking attempt" to trigger an invalid login error (due to the fact that a player ID containing non-digit characters triggered such an error).
    + Caused the login window to stay open during a login attempt, closing when a network response is recieved that does not indicate incorrect details. If the user details are incorrect, this is reported to the user who has the opportunity to re-enter them.

Version 2.3.0
    + Added command to open the user's player page in the native browser
    - Created global settings object to hold constant values
        - Moved the remote server definition to settings
